# MoGlove
Open Source Machine trained Flex Based Mocap Glove

"MoGlove" is an open-source ESP32 based Wireless mocap solution developed for indie level finger tracking on a limited budget.
MoGlove is the first flex based finger tracking solution with Machined trained pattern recognition to predict common hand gestures and poses based on curliness of fingers. 
MoGlove uses tensorflow lite for microcontrollers, which handles all the recognition on the embedded board.

*BVH format does not support native finger tracking capabillity...

# Education
MoGlove also includes user customizable pose assets, as well as a sampling program(linux) to train custom tensorflow models.
MoGlove project is aimed to be beginner friendly dive into the world of machine learning experience with absolutely minimum coding thanks to elegant library "EloquentML" for microcontrollers (Only 3 lines in total).
User have the flexibillity to customize poses, or even train it if desired.
